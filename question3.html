<h2>Data types in Javascript:</h2>
<h3>Primitive data types</h3>
<h4>1.String :</h4>
      <pre>The string data type is used to represent textual data
        (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using
        single or double quotes surrounding one or more
        characters.It represents textual data.
       
        ex:  var a = 'Hi!';
        var d = 'welcome to js';
    </pre>



<h4>2.Number :</h4>
        <pre>The number data type is used to represent positive
            or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or 
           numbers written using exponential notation.It contains
           integer,float and complex numbers.
             
           ex :  var a = 24;
                    var b = 90.3;
                     var c = 3.64e+8;</pre>

<h4>3.Boolean :</h4>
        <pre>The Boolean data type can hold only two values:
            true or false. It is typically used to store values like
            yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. 
           
           ex :  var isReading = true;
                    var isSleeping = false;</pre> 

<h4>4.Undefined :</h4>
           <pre>The undefined data type can only have one
            value-the special value undefined. If a variable has
            been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has
            the value undefined.
           
           ex :  var a;
                    var b = "Hello World"
                     alert(a)   //o/p:undefined
                      alert(b) //o/p: Hello World</pre>

<h4>5.Null :</h4>
          <pre>It  is a special value that represents empty or 
unknown value.

ex :   let number = null;</pre>

<h2>Non-primitive data types</h2>

<h4>The <mark>Object</mark> Data Type :</h4>
    <pre>An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
        
        Ex:
        var emptyObject = {};
        var person = {"name": "Clark", "surname": "Kent", "age": "36"};</pre>

<h4>The <mark>Array</mark> Data Type :</h4>
    <pre>An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].
       
        Ex: 
        var colors = ["Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Orange"];</pre>

<h4>The <mark>Function</mark> Data Type :</h4>
    <pre>The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below:
        var greeting = function(){ 
            return "Hello World!";</pre> 
    }
